                <p class="project-description">High Octane Heat is a board game I created as a group project for my
                    Emergent Design class. Itâ€™s a roll the dice racing game that has plays like monopoly, where the
                    spaces you land on can give you an edge or set you back. For this project, we had 10 weeks to
                    develop the concept behind our game and make it real. At the start of this project, my group and I
                    tested a handful of games to draw inspiration from for the game mechanics we would like to
                    implement. Over the next 3 weeks, we worked to come up with our concept, make a rough draft of game,
                    and refine the playability of the game until it reached a point where our desired age group could
                    play the game with ease. The remaining 5 weeks, we created the visuals for the pieces and the box
                    and ordered them for the final presentation. As with every design project, it has room for
                    improvement, but I feel that my group and I developed a good game that all of us could be proud of.
