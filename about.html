                <p class="bio">Hey there! I'm Hunter, a recent graduate from Eastern Washington
                    University. In addition to earning my Bachelor's Degree in Visual Communication Design, I have also
                    earned a User Experience Certificate. Ever since I discovered design in high school, I've been
                    completely hooked. I’ve always had creative mind, and design became the perfect outlet to utilize
                    it. What I love most is the ability to create something that has a real purpose. Design allows me to
                    bring ideas to life and make a meaningful impact.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m someone who also has a wide range of interests. I love cars, video games, and pretty much all
                    things 80s. I also love nerdy things like Star Wars, Harry Potter, Comics, and Dungeons & Dragons.
                    So, if you're in search of a designer who can approach projects with a serious attitude while also
                    injecting a bit of fun into the process, then you may have just found the right person.
