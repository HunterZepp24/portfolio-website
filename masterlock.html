                <p class="project-description">This project was originally created as a final project for my Production
                    Design class. The objective behind this project was to take a product that used a lot of plastic and
                    other non-sustainable materials in its packaging and redesign it with sustainability in mind. I
                    chose a Master Lock padlock to redesign as the packaging it comes in is made entirely of plastic
                    with a thin sheet of cardboard for the visuals on the packaging. After the redesign, I ended up with
                    a very small box made out of recycled paperboard. The pattern used on the packaging was inspired by
                    the famous Louis Vuitton pattern but using some of the iconography of Master Lock. I believe this
                    project was a major success and is one of the best I’ve made as a designer.

                <h1 class="project-header">Concept Sketches</h1>
                <p class="project-description">The first step of this project was to come up with a few different
                    concepts for the packaging. After a significant amount of ideation, I narrowed my ideas down to
                    these 3 concepts and sketched them out. The first concept would contain the entire lock with a
                    window on the front side of the box to showcase the lock. This concept was a decent idea but the
                    structure of the box was flimsy due to the window and the materials used. The second concept would
                    be a narrow pocket that contained the keys and wrapped around the shackle. This was another decent
                    idea but was deemed impractical due to the minimal space available in this type of packaging. The
                    third and final concept would utilize the shackle as the hanger and have a sleeve that would hold
                    the keys in the box. This was the most successful concept and the one I moved forward with as the
                    packaging would be sturdy, innovative, and reusable.

                <h1 class="project-header">Dielines and Mockups</h1>
                <p class="project-description">After deciding on the concept for my packaging, my next task was to
                    create a mockup to test the concept. Creating a mockup the box and the sleeve was a relatively
                    simple task and it had a solid structure with adequate space to use for the design aspect of the
                    project. From this point, I needed to create some dielines of the box and another mock up
                    using that newly created dieline. This was another relatively simple task as I created the dielines
                    in Adobe Illustrator, carefully utilizing rulers and guides to create accurate dielines and mockups
                    of my concept. During this process, I found out I could print two boxes and sleeves on one 8.5” x
                    11”
                    piece of paper.

                <p class="project-description">Once my initial dielines were created, it was time to start working on
                    the design of the box. This was the most involved part of the project, as we were allowed to go in
                    any direction we chose. I initially came up with three color variations of the pattern: black, red,
                    and a black-to-red gradient. Each week, I would add more information to the box and adjust the
                    design, creating several mockups to ensure good readability. The gradient version of the design was
                    the least successful due to poor readability and the colors becoming muddy when printed. The black
                    pattern looked great, but the red text was difficult to read. The red pattern also looked good, and
                    the black text was the easiest to read. So the decision was made to use the red pattern with black
                    text on the box and the black pattern on the key sleeve for the final design.
