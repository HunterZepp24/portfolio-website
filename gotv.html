                <p class="project-description">The goal of this project was to design a set of posters for the Get Out
                    the Vote campaign. Each poster is meant to be presented in 3 different formats, an 11x17 poster, a
                    digital poster for screens, and a social media post. The target audience for this project was
                    Eastern Washington University students. The concept behind this poster fell right into place. As I
                    was searching for resources for this project, I came across rockthevote.org and the idea to use
                    Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as the graphic for the poster popped into my head. This worked out because
                    a lot of people in this target audience love The Rock. For the tagline, I took a spin on one of his
                    most famous sayings, “Do you smell what The Rock is cooking?” I had a good time designing this
                    poster and it is another successful project.
