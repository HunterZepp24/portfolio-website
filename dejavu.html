                <p class="project-description">Deja Vu is a text-based adventure game I made for my Emergent Design
                    class. For this assignment, we were given the task of creating a text-based adventure game using the
                    open source software Decker. We could use any theme, visuals, audio, animations, and
                    interactions we wanted to, but we were graded on the story we created. When I finished working on
                    this game, my instructor approached me to submit it for review to be featured in the 2023 EWU
                    Student Research and Creative Works Symposium. After going through the peer review process, it was
                    ultimately selected to be featured and I presented the game to the attendees and other presenters at
                    the event. Despite this game’s simplicity, the story intrigues the player and makes them want to win
                    the game. Overall, I couldn’t be more happy with how this game turned out.
